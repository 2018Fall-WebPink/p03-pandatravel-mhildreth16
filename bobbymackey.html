        <p> The well-known murder trials are about a 22 year old woman named Pearl. That night Pearl lied to her parents and went out <br /> with her friend Scott Jack son and his roommate, Alanzo Walling. All three of them travled across the Ohio River. Jackson <br /> took them to a seluded spot in Kentucky near Fort Thomas where Jackson and Walling severed her head from her body. </p>

        <p> Pearl's head was never found and people believed that it was used in a satanic ritual in the slaughter house that is now called<br /> <b> Bobby Mackey's. </b> Jackson and Wallings were sentenced to life in prison and was later hanged. Now it is rumored that <br /> Pearl's ghost is still there seeking for revenge. But Pearl is not alone.</p>
